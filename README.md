# Cloud-Computing-projects
In this project, we developed an app inspired by [privetnote](https://privnote.com/). 
This lightweight application is implemented by flask, dockerized, and deployed on Kubernetes. 

## Table of Contents




## Web Application
This web application lets you create notes and, after that, gives you a  link to access the notes' content; each note can be read only once. After reading the message or after a specific amount of time (the Default is 30 seconds, but it is configurable), the note will be deleted. 
The web server is implemented using ```Flask```, which is connected to a ```MySQL``` database. You can find codes here.
